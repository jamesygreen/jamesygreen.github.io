    <h3> Team Naming and thought showers </h3>
    <br>
<p> I was placed in a group with Scott and Victoria, I felt this was a very good match for me as i already knew both of them were great workers. The first thing Victoria said was that she had a client lined up. This let us get a head start and begin planning. The client still had to provide us with information about the company she owns, all we knew was that it was to do with hand crafted items. We began thought showering and came up with the name, <em>"Byte Desgin"</em></p>

<p> Victoria told us that the client already owned a domain name. This was very helpful as we didnt have to go looking for one, saving us time aswell as giving us something to work with. We checked to make sure her domain name was ok to use and we started planning.</p>

<h3> Logo Desgin and Branding </h3>
    <br>
    <p><em>"The web moves fast. Really fast. What is new today, will be a convention in six months time." - Boulton M. (2009)</em></p>
<br>
<p> Our client had a logo and branding set in place already, however we didnt like it too much and felt we could do much better, the first thing we did is started sketching ideas, Scott started to create idea in illustrator while me a victoria did some research on logos to try to get some ideas of which would suit the site best.</p>
<p>When scott finished his desgin both me and Victoria really liked it and decided to go with his idea.</p>
     <center><img src="images/clientlogo.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 1: Clients Logo</strong></p>
       <hr>
       <p> The main font we used was Sophia Nubian Font family, we felt that it went with the logo and was very clear to read,  making it bery useful when getting good information across </p>
       <hr>
       
     <h3> Finding Client </h3>
     <br>
     
     <p> Victoria was approached by a family member, her Uncles wife, Elaine Allen. She ask victoria if she was capable of creating a website for her handcrafting business. When we were assigned the group project victoria offered the suggestion of building a website for Elaine but we just needed to check with her first as she could be agasint the suggestion.</p>
  <p> Ellaine was more than happy to let us work away on a website for her. She briefed Victoria roughly on what she wanted, this let us get on with some work and start thought showering for good ideas</p>
     <hr>
     
     <h3> Team Planning and Organization </h3>
     <br>
     <p> We did a rough plan on what we thought we needed to do. Victoria briefed us on what Elaine Allen told her. We came to an understanding of what company Elaine had and what type website would best suit her ideas. </p>
     <p> Victiora was team leader, she was brilliant and took control of the group very well. After we figuired out what we wanted for the website, we talked about what we should do first and what order we are gonig to do things. Victoria took control and we sat round her computer, browsing through other websites and voicing our opions of what we liked and what we disliked.</p>
    
    <hr>
    <h3> Team Roles </h3>
    <br>
   <p> Scott Created the Gantt chart, as a group we decided that he was best and it should be done properly to keep us on track. we used the Gantt chart to figure out what we needed to do and roughly how long we have to do each part. </p>
   
   <ul>
   <li>Myself, Web Developer </li>
   <br>
   <li>Victotria, Project Manager </li>
   <br>
   <li>Scott, MySQL Developer </li>
   </ul>
   <hr>
   
   <h3> Understanding The Desgin Process </h3>
   <br>
  <p> By week three claire assigned us a task instructing us to do some research and figuring out our terms of reference. Claire resecently told us about a book <em>"Designing for the web by Mark Boulton"</em>. I found this book really intriging and thought id benieft from atleast reading it. </p>
<p> The book covers all aspects of the work we had to do, aswell as reading online for my own research </p> 
   
   <hr>
  
  <h3> Terms Of Reference </h3>
  <br>
  <p> We Completed the terms of reference for claire, we had to have the work in on the 1st of October. The document included client proposal, Gantt chart and target market. Scott created the gantt chart previous of the project making it much easier for us to work on in schedule and keeping us organized.</p>
  
  <p> Each member comunicated well and did what was set for them, we finished work early and talked over the term of reference before submitting, this allowed us to make sure everything was ok collectively. I felt like out team was well balanced and focused. </p>
  <br>
<p> Check out our copy of terms of reference <a href="images/termsofreference.pdf"> here. </a> </p>

 <h3> Colour Theory Research </h3>
    <br>
    <p><em>"At its heart, colour theory is concerned with the creation of colour combinations via relationships. The relationships are created by the position of the colours on the colour wheel." Boulton (2009)</em></p>
 <br>
 <p> After handing in the terms of reference it was time to start with colour theory and research. Claire gave us a refresher on colour theory a quick outline of each colour scheme. she took us through how to apply the theory towards pint and on the web. I felt this was very handy as it refreshed my memory and made me remember certain small aspect which gets the higher grades </p>
 <br>
    <p> To understand how colours work and to get myself a refresher i am going to first take a look at the colour wheel. This will give me an idea of what colours go together and what the colour wheel is made up of, Primary, Secondary and Tertiary colours. </p>
    <center><img src="images/colorschemes.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 2: Colour Schemes</strong></p>
    <p><em>"What evokes one reaction in one person may evoke a very different reaction in somone else." - Cameron Chapman (01/28/1010)</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>To help me get a better understanding i used Adobe kuler, Colour wheel. It helped me understand the five main types of colour scheme there are and why each one is being used for different reasons. </p>
    <p> Five main types are:</p>
    <ul>
   <li>Monochromatic</li>
   <li>Analogous </li>
   <li>Trid </li>
    <li>Complementary </li>
    <li>Compound </li>
   </ul>
    <hr>
    <p>The first colour scheme i am going to look at is Monochromatic, this colour scheme is derived from a single base hue, using shades, tones and tints. </p>
    <p>The use of a monochromatic colour scheme provides a very professional feel about the website aswell as helping towards communication as it can highlight certain section much easier.</p>
    <p><em>"Monochrome selections are simply one colour from the colour wheel." Boulton (2009) </em></p>
    <center><img src="images/monochromatic.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 3: Monochromatic Colour theory</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p> The next colour scheme i am going to talk about is Analogous. This colour scheme uses colours that are next to eachother on the colour wheel. Analogous schemes are usually found in nature, e.g. During Autumn when different shades of leaves fall.  </p>
    <p> Analogous colour schemes are very pleasing to the eye. This would be a good colour scheme if the website i was doing was outdoors or nature. however unfortunitly its not so i think i wont be using it on the website i am goin to create.</p>
    <center><img src="images/Analogous.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 4: Analogous Colour theory</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The next colour scheme is Triad. A triadic colour scheme uses colours that are evenly spaced around the colour wheel.</p>
    <p>A Triad colour tends to be quite vibrant even when pale colour are used. It can be hard to use a Triad coliur scheme, to do it properly the colours need to be carefully balanced, by letting ne colour dominate and use the other two for accent</p>
    <p><em>"Triad colours are any three colours which are equidistant on the colour wheel. As all three colours contrast with one another they can clash and this is where the tension is created" Boulton (2009)</em></p>
    <center><img src="images/triad.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 5: Triad Colour theory</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>I then took a look at Complementary colour scheme. This is pairs of colors which when combined they cancel eachother out.
    Due to this striking colour clash, the term opposite colours is often considered more appropriate that Complementary colours.</p>
    <p><em>"Complementary selections are based on contrasting colours. Sometimes they look horrible and simply do not work." Boulton (2009)</em></p>
    <center><img src="images/complimentary.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 6: Complementary Colour Scheme</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The last colour scheme i am going to dicuss is Compound. Also known as Split-Complemntary. This colour scheme is a variation of the complementary colour scheme</p>
    <p>Compound colour scheme has the same strong visual aspects as complementary however is s hass less pressure making it easier to look at.</p>
    <center><img src="images/compound.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 7: Compound/ Split-complementary Colour Scheme</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>The images above shows what colours goes with others, they explain how the colour wheel works. This will help me understand my clients and other competitors websites. </p>
    <br>
    <p><em>“Colours, when selected from from the colourwheel in certain combinations, interact together. This is the basis of colour palettes; the interaction of colours.” Boulton (2009)</em> </p>
    <br>
    <p>After understanding the colour wheel, Due to our client being in the handcrafting sales, i am going to take a look at other similar sites, the first website i am going to look at is Esty</p>
    <p>https://www.etsy.com/uk/</p>
    <center> <img src="images/esty.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 8: Esty Website.</strong></p>
    <p>The designers of Esty website used very light grey for the background and darker greys for the writing. This makes the website look very professional and easy to read all text.</p>
    <p>""quote""</p>
    <br>
    <p>Esty have used the Monochromatic colour scheme. Monochromatic colour shcemes are created from a single base hue and extended using shades, this is when you add black to a pure hue </p>
    <center><img src="images/estyshades.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 9: Shades Colour theory</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Monochromatic seems to be the colour theory i use the most of, it creates a nice clean look and can be implimented very well using white space. It is also very easy to manage, due to it being the same colour just different shades. This also makes it very visually appealing aswell as making it look very balanced.</p>
    <p> Esty Use this very well, they use different shades of orange through out the website, this stands out very well against the light grey background and the darker grey writing. Making everything vissually appealing and easy to read. This means protiental customers are more likely to read on and purchase a product. </p>
    <hr>
    <p> <em> Jennifer Bourn says the use of the colour orange throughout the website is assoicated with the meaning of joy and creativity. Orange promotes a sense of general wellness and emotionasl energy  </em></p>        
        <hr>
    <p> The next website i am going to look at is MadeItMyself. Its another handcrafting website, this will also help me towards my final project and creating a website for my client. </p>
    <center><img src="images/madeitmyself.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong> Figure 10: MadeItMyself website </strong> </p>
    <br>
    <p> The colour scheme used by MadeItMyself is complementary, It is made up of two colours that are opposite eachother on the colour wheel. When using complementary colour schemes it is important to use the more dominant colour as the background and using another colour that complements the other. </p>
    <center><img src="images/complimentary.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong> Figure 11: Complementary Colour Scheme </strong></p>
    <br>
<p> I personally dont use this colour scheme, I feel it is very hard to get the two colours that i would want to work in this scheme.The high contracts when using complementary colours creates a very vibrant look. Complementary colours are tricky to use, however they work very well to make somethings stand out. </p>
<p> Complementary colour should not be used for text, it makes the writing very hard to see and protential customers dont want to be straining thier eyes to read information. </p>
<hr>
<p>The last website i did was Dawanda. it is the largest german handcrafted shop. Its website is very nice and looks very professional.</p>
<center><img src="images/dawanda.jpg"/></center>
<p><strong> Figure 12: Dawanda's Website</strong></p>
<br>
<p> Dawanda use black and red throughout the website, this gives a very clear and clean feel, they used red for their logo, this means users eyes are immediately drawn to the name, which leads customers to the navigation bar</p>
 <center><img src="images/dawandalogo.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong> Figure 13: Dawanda Logo</strong>   
<P>They have used red throughout the website, just keeping the reader’s attention in each section, highlighting where they should be looking, this is very effective as it can be used to display information you want users to see</P>

<p>Dawanda use a monochromic colour scheme, not using too many colours, keeping it simple but very effective using the absence of colour and the presents of colour with red though out. It is easy to manage and very visually appealing. </p>
<p><em>" Knowing the basis of these colour combination types is essential in creating palettes" Boulton (2009)</em> </p>
