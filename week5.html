    <h2> Typography </h2>
    <br>
    <p><em>"Typographic design is one of those fields in design that is taken for granted. Many designers just choose a cool font and away they go" Boutlon (2009)</em></p>
<p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written lanaguage readable. There are hundreds of thousands typefaces out there, for picky people this can be a nightmare. </p>
<p>The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process</p>
    <hr>

    <h3> Font Family</h3>
       
    <p>There are two types of typefaces. These are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Serif</li>
    <li>Sans-serif</li>
    </ul>
    
    <hr>
    <h3>Serif </h3>
    
    <p><em>"A typeface will have serifs, or it won't. If it doesn't, it's called a sans–serif. If it does, then the serif will either be a bracketed, a hairline, a flare, or a slab serif." Boulton (2009) </em></p>
    
    <p>Serif are the small lines tailing from the edges of letters and symbols separated into distinct units for typewriter or typesetter, due to this Serif fonts are easier to read in printed work.</p>
    <p>This is because the serif make the individual letters more distinctive and easier for our brains to recognise quicker</p>

    <p> However serif is harder to read when online, thats why serif is ussualy used for body text because it is more legible and less likely to cause fatigue</p>
    <center><img src="images/tail.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong> Figure 1: Serif Font  </strong></p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Sans Serif</h3>
    <p>Sans-serif is a typeface that does not have the small projecting features called "serifs" at the end of strokes, due to this san-serif are much better on the web.</p>
   
    <p>An important exception must be made for the web. Printed works generally have a resolution of at least 1000 dots per inch; whereas computer monitors are typically around 100 dots per inch.</p>
    <p> i feel that san-serif is the more attractive typeface, much easier to read and much more easier to use and make work on the web.</p>
    
    <center><img src="images/sansserif.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong> Figure 2: Sans-Serif Font  </strong></p>
    
    <hr>
    <h3> Typesetting </h3>
    
    <p>Typesetting is the process, the craft, of setting the type for a document. Typesetting is the process of arranging the text and images in a page, in order to prepare them for printing. This includes selecting the most adequate style, size and composition of each and every text chain, photograph and design element.</p>
    
    <p>There are several adjustments that can be made to affect typography.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Tracking</li>
    <li>Kerning</li>
    <li>Leading</li>
    <li>Measure</li>
    <li>Alignment</li>
    <li>Ligatures</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h4> Tracking</h4>
    <p>Tracking is often confused for kerning, but the concept is a little different. Tracking involves adjusting the spacing throughout the entire word. </p>
    <p>You should be very careful when changing the tracking, as it can quickly lead to difficulty in reading.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4> Kerning</h4>
    <p>Kerning also adjusts space, but of the distance between two letters. Set too closely together, words are indecipherable; set too far apart, and they're awkward to read.</p>
    <p>If some spacing is wide and some narrow, it can be frustrating for someone to read without fully understanding what’s wrong, One of the most important aspects of kerning is to have proportional spacing between each letter, taking into consideration any serifs .</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4> Leading</h4>
    <p>Leading is an essential design aspect that determines how text is spaced vertically in lines.</p>
    <p>For content that has multiple lines of readable text, you'll want to make sure the distance from the bottom of the words above to the top of the words below has appropriate spacing to make them legible.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Measure</h4>
    <p>Measure is the length of a line of text. For a single-column design measure should ideally lie between 40 and 80 characters.</p>
    <p> If the lines are too short then the text becomes disjointed, if they are too long the content loses rhythm as the reader searches for the start of each line.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Alignment</h4>
    <p>Alignment is an extremely important concept in typography. For some reason, non-designers tend to instinctively center align everything.</p>
    <p>In reality, center alignment is the weakest, hardest to read alignment and should be used very selectively.</p>
    <br>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
    <p><em>"Typographic hierarchy, put simply, is how different faces, weights and sizes of typefaces structure a document" Boulton (2009)</em></p>
    <p>The page as a whole must be designed in a way that clearly communicates to the user what actions are available and how to easily access the information they seek, How to leave comment or buy an item, etc.</p>
    <p>One of the most important aspects of communicating a strong typographic hierarchy. The styling and placement of all elements, both type and images should guide the viewer through the content in order of importance.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em>“Typography exists to honor content.”- Robert Bringhurst: The Elements of Typographic Style</em></p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Weight and Width</h3>
    <p>The weight of a particular font is the thickness of the character outlines relative to their height. A typeface may come in fonts of many weights and heights. The base weight differs among typefaces; that means one normal font may appear bolder than some other normal font.</p>
    <p> Some typefaces include fonts that vary the width of the characters, although this feature is usually rarer than weight, Narrower fonts are usually labeled compressed, condensed or narrow.</p>
    <br>
    <p><em> "The second digit of condensed fonts is a 7. Wider fonts may be called wide, extended or expanded. Both can be further classified by prepending extra, ultra or the like." - Frutiger's system</em></p>
    
    <hr>
    <h3>Client</h3>
    <p>Due to out client not having a website for me to dicuss yet, I will dicuss Competitors websites, Due to the industry being bout selling handcrafted products, these competitors websites will be mainly image based with very little text</p>
    <br>
    <h4> Esty </h4>
    <center> <img src="images/esty.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 3: Esty Website.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <div class="col-lg-6 center">
    <p>Esty uses Sans Serif throughout the website, this makes text very easy to read and makes the website look professional. Due to the tidiness of Sans Serif being individual letters, it makes the website more consistent and user friendly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6 center">
        <center> <img src="images/estytext.jpg"/></center>
        <center><p><strong>Figure 4: Esty Sans-Serif.</strong></p></center>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h4> MadeItMyself </h4>
    <center> <img src="images/madeitmyself.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 5: MadeItMyself Website.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <div class="col-lg-6 center">
    <p>The most part of MadeItMyself is San Serif, this makes everything easy to ready and doesn’t over complicate anything. However they have used san serif in one of the images as well as using it in the logo on the “it” has been messed with this done well can create a good separation of information and branding, although I feel that it’s meant to make it stand out however I feel that it looks very childish and could have been done a lot more subtle to make the website that bit more professional.</p>
        <p>I feel that the writing on figure 7 is very poor, it took me a couple of minutes to figure out what was even wrote on it
This shouldn’t have been placed at the top of the website, it is hard to read and will confuse potential customers
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6 center">
        <center> <img src="images/madeitmyselftext.jpg"/></center>

    <br>
    <h4> Dawanda </h4>
    <center> <img src="images/dawanda.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 8: Dawanda Website.</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>Dawanda uses Serif the whole way throughout, I think it works very well as they didn’t go over the top, it looks neat and isn’t too bad to read, however san serif for important details would of looked better, I still like the way they have done it.</p>
    
    <br>
    <hr>
    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <p>I personally believe layout is one of the most important aspects or as important as colour and typography. Layout creates a clear and easy to understand guidline aroud the webpage.</p> 
    <br>
    <h3>Mobile</h3>
    <p>Designers have it tougher now than before, not only do they have to design for computer screens and laptops, they have to design for mobile devices with lots of different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
    <p>However, Responsive web design could be the best solution for most cases. It makes a flexible layout design which can fit into any possible screen resolution.
    Most WordPress websites do this for you, but HTML ones don’t. When creating an HTML site you must add in Media Queries to make it responsive.</p>
    <center> <img src="images/responsive.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 8: Responsive Site layout.</strong></p>
    <br>
    
    <p><em>“Laying out a website design is where all of the different aspects of web design come into play. From research, information architecture, and user experience design through to the typography, colour and grid systems. Creating a layout combines all of these, but as web designers, we have to factor in other variables such as browser type, screen size and resolution.” Boulton M. (2009)</em></p>
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
    <p>he grid works horizontally or vertically and helps you determine how the eye follows an image or group of images such as a website</p>
    <p>The rule of thirds has been around for hundreds of years and was first referenced by <em>John Thomas in 1797 "Remarks on Rural Scenery”.</em> </p>
    <p>The theory behind it is Understanding where these key points fall can help you determine a more appealing crop and even determine placement of elements on your website’s </p>
    <center> <img src="images/ruleofthird.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 9: Rule of Third.</strong></p>
    <br>
    
    <h3>Looking Room</h3>
    <p>Many web sites use imagery, or photographs, to enhance the content. But even with professionally shot photographs, without a basic understanding of framing or composition, you can damage how the image is shown</p>
    <p>A simple, easy way to make photographs more interesting is to fill the frame. Figure 10 shows that By closely cropping, and filling the frame, we can instantly change the mood of the shot.</p>
    <br>
    <center> <img src="images/lookingroom.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 10: Looking Room.</strong></p>
    <hr>
    
    <h3>Subject, Space and Movement</h3>
    
    <p>Visual interest ein photographs can come from movement; how the eye moves around the shot. To get the eye moving, the photographer modifies the space around the subject</p>
    <center> <img src="images/space.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 11:Subject, Space and Movement- Boultons Example .</strong></p>
    <br>
    <p>The photography has framed the subject on the right, allowing for whitespace, or Looking Room, in the direction the subject is looking. The framing of the subject (1), with the space to the left (2) – the Looking Room – creates movement, shown by the arrow (3)</p>
    
    <p><em>“Generally speaking, a portrait photograph will have a subject and space around them. Visual interest in portrait photography can come from movement; how the eye moves around the shot. To get the eye moving, the photographer modifies the space around the subject. The photographer has framed the subject on the right, allowing for whitespace, or Looking Room, in the direction the subject is looking. The framing of the subject (1), with the space to the left (2) ” the Looking Room ” creates movement, shown by the arrow (3).” – Boulton M. (2009).</em></p>

    <h3>The Triangle (hierarchy) </h3>
    <p><em>"The humble triangle is a powerful aid in composing layouts. For centuries, the triangle has been used to guide the eye of the reader or viewer, particularly in fine art. The Last Supper, by Leonardo da Vinci, is perhaps one of the most well known paintings to use triangles as a primary compositional device." Boulton M. (2009)</em></p>
     <center><a herf="http://www.designingfortheweb.co.uk/part5/part5_chapter21.php"> <img src="images/lastsupper.jpg"/> </center> </a>
    <p><strong>Figure 12: The Trianlge - Boulton M .(2009)</strong></p>
    <center> <a herf="http://www.designingfortheweb.co.uk/part5/part5_chapter21.php"> <img src="images/lastsuppertriangle.jpg"/></center> </a>
    <p><strong>Figure 13: The Trianlge - Boulton M .(2009)</strong></p>
    <p> Boulton says that the triangle is a powerful tool which can be used in design. as shown in figure 13, jesus is the center on the image, with white space left around him shown by the red triangles. Showing that even Leonardo da vinci used white spacing when painting the last supper.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><em>Having three points of focus on a design provides a balance and subsequent movement of the reader's eye. - Boulton M. (2009).</em></p>
    <hr>
    
    <h3> White Spacing </h3>
    <p>white space is often referred to as negative space. It is the portion of a page left unmarked</p>
    
    <p><em>“White, or Negative Space is the space in between elements in a composition; be that a web page, a web app or a spread in a magazine.
        Actually, that’s only a part truth. The space between major elements in a composition is Macro White Space. Micro White space, is, yes you’ve guessed it, the White Space between elements such as list items, the space between a caption and an image, or the space between words and letters.”  – Boulton M. (2009).</em></p>
    <p> The best with white spacing is Google, it is so clean and fresh it works very well</p>
    <center><img src="images/google.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 13: Google white space</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Grid System</h3>
    <p><em>"In the context of graphic design, a grid is an instrument for ordering graphical elements of text and images. The grid is a child of Constructivist art and came into being through the same thought processes that gave rise to that art movement" - Boulton.M (2009)</em></p>
    <p> it is very important to understand the grid system in graphic and web design, it leads the users to the work you actually want them to see </p>
    <hr>
    <h3> Client </h3>
    <p>Due to our client not having a website yet i am not able to discuss it, however i will discuss competitors.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>Esty</h4>
    <center><img src="images/esty.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Figure 14: Esty</strong></p>
    <br>
     <div class="col-lg-6 center">
    <p>Esty website is very good, it had brilliant structure and placement of information, it has a horizontal navigation bar which links up all pages all in the same section. It has dropdown list which supply further link to additional pages making navigating round the website much easier and it clearly shows that accessibility has had a lot of thought put into it.   
Esty also has a “shop by category” section, this gives all the different things it sells and a picture to represent the image, I thought this was a very good idea and also looked very professional, aswell as making shopping for a particular item much easier “figure 16”.

    <br>
     
    <p>MadeItMyself has a horizontal and vertical navigation bar, it has quick access on the left and a basic navigation on the top. The website is very much what you see is what you get, it doesn’t have many dropdown lists and just shows off the products just by placing them in. however it has categories such as featured items, making the best items appear first.  The first image you see is a massive Facebook link, which I don’t like as it shouldn’t be the first thing a customer see’s.
I feel like this website is upside down, it has all the good deals at the bottom of the page and the just random items at the top, I think more thought should have been put in to the layout.

 <p>Dawanda have created a very good website, the horizontal navigation links the entire website together in the same place, makes navigating much quicker and easier. They have a slider at the top of the website, which shows off the best deals they offer, as well as creating a “what’s trending” section, giving customers the option to see what’s in style and what’s selling well. 
All these features ensure customers don’t get lost and everything is easily assessable, making it all very efficient. </p>
