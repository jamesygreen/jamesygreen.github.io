    <h1> Team Minutes </h1>
    <p> Present: Victoria Allen, Scott Millar</p>
    <p>Absent: James Green</p>
    <p><strong>Wednesday 14th September</strong></p>
    <p>Today we were tasked with creating a team brand, which included a name and logo. Myself and Scott researched words associated with computers and web design, the name we decided on was Byte Design. We then began to create a logo firstly on paper, sketching out designs and ideas. After a few attempts at different styles and researching existing logo designs for web developers we decided upon our logo.</p>

    <p><strong>Monday 19th September</strong></p>
    <p>Due to James not being present for our first team meeting the first point that we decided to make was to show him the brand and logo that myself and Scott had created. We wanted to get Jamesâ€™ thoughts on it before going ahead with it and if there would be anything he would have liked to change. He agreed with what we had created and so we were able to move onto the next step. We discussed our client and what the focus of their website will be. </p>

    <p> As victoria was the only one in class this day she was unable to have a team meeting and so I worked on my new website and the Blog page that would be included in it, as well as the minutes from previous meetings. </p>

    <p><strong>Monday 26th September</strong></p>
    <p>We came together as a team to discuss the Terms of Reference document that we will have to create as the starting point for our client brief. We discussed the examples online and how we would layout the document. We decided that the easiest and most fair way of creating the document would be to split it into sections, writing a section each. We would then come together in our next meeting to discuss what we have each did individually. </p>

    <p><strong>wednesday 28th September</strong></p>
    <p>Today we came together with all of our individual sections for the Terms of Reference document. After piecing it together and finishing off a few last minute details such as the index and referencing, we were ready to hand it in to be looked over before presenting it to our client.   </p>

    <p><strong>wednesday 12th October</strong></p>
    <p>  We arranged a meeting with our client through Victoria, as she is our liaison, to give her the Terms of Reference document. We sat with her whilst she read through it in order to answer any questions she may have had during the meeting. She was pleased with the information within the document and we all signed off on this document.  </p>

    <p>Absent: Victoria Allen,</p>
    <p><strong>Monday 10th October</strong></p>
    <p> Today we came together to discuss the Terms of Reference document that we previously created. We revised some of the content within the document such as the Management summary and the Gantt Chart, to ensure this document was of the highest standard to give to our client.</p>
